## Technical Approach

### Architecture

How will this fit into the existing system?

- Component diagram / description
- Data flow
- State management approach
- API design

### Technologies

What technologies will we use?

- Libraries/frameworks
- New dependencies
- Build tools
- Testing approach

### Design Patterns

What established patterns will we follow?

- UI patterns (card-based, modal system, etc.)
- Data patterns (real-time subscriptions, etc.)
- Code organization
- Reference implementations

### Database Changes

What database modifications are needed?

- New tables
- Schema changes
- Migrations required
- Data seeding needs

## Testing Strategy

How will we verify this works?

### Unit Tests
- Components to test
- Coverage goals

### Integration Tests
- Integration points
- Scenarios to cover

### Manual Testing
- Test cases
- Edge cases
- Browser/device matrix

### User Acceptance
- Who will test?
- Success criteria
- Feedback collection

## Rollout Plan

How will we deploy this to production?

### Deployment Steps
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3

### Feature Flags
- Which features are toggled?
- Rollout percentage
- Rollback plan

### Migration Strategy
- Data migration approach
- Backward compatibility
- Rollback procedures

## Risks & Mitigation

What could go wrong and how do we handle it?

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Risk 1 | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | How we'll prevent/handle it |
| Risk 2 | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | How we'll prevent/handle it |

## Success Criteria

How do we know we're done?

### Functional Requirements
