## Introduction (华桥简介)
In **2004**, Mr. **Frank Yih (叶守璋)** — a Shanghai-born entrepreneur educated in the UK and USA, and a pioneer in Silicon Valley — together with a group of warm-hearted overseas Chinese (华侨), established the **HuaQiao Foundation (HQF, 华桥基金会)** in Hong Kong, with its first office in **Shanghai (上海)**.  

The name **“HuaQiao (华桥)”** is a deliberate wordplay:  
- It sounds like *Huaqiao (华侨)*, meaning “overseas Chinese.”  
- It literally means **“Chinese Bridge”** — symbolizing a bridge of communication between overseas Chinese and their compatriots at home.  

From its inception, HQF has focused on providing humanitarian assistance in **education (教育)**, **health and sanitation (健康卫生)**, and **public welfare development (公益发展)** to underdeveloped areas of East and West China.  

In **2016**, under the guidance of the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau (上海民政局), HQF registered a new entity — the **Guofeng Charity Foundation (国峯慈善基金会, GFCF)** — to take over all mainland projects. HQF’s 12-year summary thus serves both as a **closure of its first cycle (十二年, one zodiac cycle)** and as a **gift to Guofeng**, to inspire its new chapter.  

Going forward, **GFCF** will continue HQF’s mission in China and surrounding regions, with a focus on **poverty alleviation (扶贫助困)**, **disaster relief (赈灾救援)**, and **education support (助学)**. HQF will maintain its international outreach and partnerships.  

## Chairman’s Remarks (会长寄言)
> “I was born in Shanghai (上海) in 1934, later studied in the UK and the USA, worked in Silicon Valley in semiconductors, and founded businesses in Southeast Asia. Despite living abroad for most of my life, when I returned to Shanghai in 1992, I felt I had truly come home.  
>
> In the early 1990s, China had only just begun its Reform and Opening (改革开放). Poverty was still widespread. Having witnessed the economic miracles of the ‘Four Asian Tigers’ (四小龙 — Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea), I deeply understood the importance of bringing in external resources and advanced ideas to help people out of poverty and improve their living standards.  
>
> With this conviction, I founded the HuaQiao Foundation in 2004 with the mission of supporting underdeveloped regions of China, helping people escape poverty. This original aspiration (初心) has never changed.”  

Over the past 12 years, HQF has sought to build **bridges**:  
- Between **East and West China (东西部)**.  
- Between **China and the world (中国与世界)**.  
- Between **poverty and wealth (贫与富)**, **rural and urban (乡村与城市)**, **material and culture (物质与文明)**.  

China has made great progress in narrowing the wealth gap, yet tens of millions still lived in poverty as of 2016. The government’s commitment to **eliminating poverty by 2020 (全面消除贫困，一个都不能少)** — ten years earlier than the UN SDGs — gave HQF confidence, and also signaled that HQF had reached a turning point.  

After **12 years (一个轮回)**, HQF decided to transition:  
- **Institutionally**: By creating the Guofeng Charity Foundation (国峯慈善基金会) in Shanghai for mainland operations.  
- **Strategically**: By focusing beyond poverty relief, toward environmental protection, education, public safety, health awareness, and cultivating appreciation for beauty and art.  

Frank Yih (叶守璋) closed with gratitude:  
> “To all colleagues and friends who have walked with us: thank you for your hard work over these 12 years. The journey of HuaQiao was only the beginning — let us join hands with Guofeng to continue building a safer, better, and more harmonious world.”
