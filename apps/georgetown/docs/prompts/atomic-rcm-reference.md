React Admin Tech Stack

Yes, Atomic CRM was originally built on react-admin, but there's an important update:
Two Versions Exist
1. Original Version (react-admin)
Built by Marmelab (the creators of react-admin) as a demo showcase
Tech stack: React + react-admin + Supabase + PostgreSQL + Material UI
Repository: https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin-crm
Purpose: Demonstrate react-admin framework capabilities for CRM use cases
2. Current/Newer Version (shadcn/ui)
No longer uses react-admin
Tech stack: React + shadcn/ui (shadcn-admin-kit) + Supabase + TypeScript
Repository: https://github.com/marmelab/atomic-crm
Modern UI component library approach instead of the react-admin framework
Key Insight
The project evolved from being a react-admin demo to a standalone CRM template using modern component libraries. The newer version provides more flexibility and uses shadcn/ui for UI components rather than the opinionated react-admin framework. Both versions are open-source and available on GitHub, with the react-admin version still maintained as an example/demo of what can be built with that framework. Sources:
