# Service Clubs in Asia: HuaQiao Foundation Digital Bridge
**For: Chairman PSR Frank Yih**
**Date:** December 2025

---

## The Problem

Service clubs across Asia face **digital poverty** while commercial platforms charge $294-997/year and block access in China.

**Pain Points:**
1. **Speaker Chaos** — 52 speakers/year managed via email. **ZERO platforms offer integrated workflow**
2. **Broken Mobile Apps** — Low ratings, slow performance, or non-existent
3. **Blocked in China** — All major platforms inaccessible (Cloudflare/US datacenters)
4. **No Offline Mode** — Critical gap for Global South bandwidth constraints
5. **Expensive** — $479-2,195/year + hidden fees for basic features

**Purpose:** Connect service clubs globally for regional partnerships

**How it works:**
1. Clubs publish service projects to public directory (opt-in)
2. Other clubs search by location/service type (water, education, health)
3. Express interest → Email connection → Partnership

**Example:** Rotary Club in Kuala Lumpur finds Georgetown's clean water project → Partners to expand to 3 more Malaysian villages
