5. **Fellowship (Friendship)**

### Avenues of Service

Five channels through which we commit to service:

### Areas of Focus

Our target causes for maximum impact:

2. **Disease prevention and treatment**
3. **Water, sanitation, and hygiene**
4. **Maternal and child health**
5. **Basic education and literacy**
6. **Community economic development**
7. **Environment**

Projects in these areas are eligible for global grant funding from The Rotary Foundation.

**Did You Know?** Rotary's motto, "Service Above Self," reflects our belief in unselfish volunteer service.

### The Four-Way Test

Developed in 1932 by Herbert Taylor (Rotary Club of Chicago member and 1954-55 RI president) to guide his attempt to save a faltering aluminum company. Rotary later adopted it as an ethical guide for members.

**Of the things we think, say, or do:**

1. Is it the TRUTH?
2. Is it FAIR to all concerned?
3. Will it build GOODWILL and BETTER FRIENDSHIPS?
4. Will it be BENEFICIAL to all concerned?

### Object of Rotary

The Object of Rotary is to encourage and foster the ideal of service as a basis of worthy enterprise and, in particular, to encourage and foster:

**FIRST:** The development of acquaintance as an opportunity for service

**SECOND:** High ethical standards in business and professions; the recognition of the worthiness of all useful occupations; and the dignifying of each Rotarian's occupation as an opportunity to serve society

**THIRD:** The application of the ideal of service in each Rotarian's personal, business, and community life

**FOURTH:** The advancement of international understanding, goodwill, and peace through a world fellowship of business and professional persons united in the ideal of service

**Note:** Principles added and updated over time (peace advancement added in 1921; gender-neutral language in 1989 and 1995)

### Diversity

**Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Statement:**

At Rotary, we understand that cultivating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture is essential to realizing our vision of a world where people unite and take action to create lasting change.

**What We Value:**
