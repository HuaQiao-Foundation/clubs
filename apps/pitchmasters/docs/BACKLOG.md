# Pitchmasters Development Backlog

**Owner**: CTO (Claude Code)
**Purpose**: Track future features and tasks without CEO project management burden
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-08

---

## Usage

**CEO adds items:**
```
"Code, backlog this: Add interactive pitch recording feature"
OR
"CTO, backlog this: Add interactive pitch recording feature"
```

**CTO response:**
1. Creates backlog entry with unique ID, scope breakdown, acceptance criteria, status
2. Confirms: "Added to backlog as #XXX"

**CEO does NOT:**
- ❌ Maintain task lists
- ❌ Track backlog status
- ❌ Manage priorities beyond "high/future/ideas"

**CTO owns:**
- ✅ All backlog maintenance
- ✅ Status tracking
- ✅ Implementation planning when item is prioritized
