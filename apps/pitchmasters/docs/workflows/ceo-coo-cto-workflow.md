# CEO-COO-CTO Workflow: Collaborative Excellence

**Context**: How we work efficiently at Pitchmasters with strategic oversight and autonomous execution.

**Key Principle**: CEO defines outcomes, COO ensures quality and feasibility, CTO owns execution completely.

---

## Role Definitions

### CEO (Business Strategy)
- Define **what** needs to be achieved and **why**
- Provide business context and success criteria
- Validate results against business objectives
- **Not responsible for**: Task lists, implementation plans, technical decisions

### COO (Strategic Advisor & Quality Assurance)
- Advise on **feasibility** and strategic alignment
- Review **quality** of technical deliverables
- Translate business needs into technical context
- Assess risks and recommend approaches
- **Not responsible for**: Code implementation, detailed debugging, blocking CTO-CEO communication

### CTO (Technical Execution)
- Determine **how** to achieve business objectives
- Create own implementation plans and task lists
- Make all technical decisions autonomously
- Execute completely without requiring step-by-step approval
- Report results when complete

## System Access Constraints

### Database (Supabase)
- **CEO has access**: Supabase dashboard and SQL Editor
- **CTO does NOT have access**: Cannot directly execute SQL
- **Workflow**: CTO writes SQL → CEO executes in Supabase → CTO verifies in application

### Deployment (Cloudflare Pages)
- **CTO has access**: Git push triggers automatic deployment
- **CEO monitors**: Verifies deployments are successful

### Source Control (GitHub)
- **Both have access**: CTO commits code, CEO can review

---

## Communication Pattern

### CEO Instruction Format
```
"I need [business outcome] for [users/members] because [business reason]"

Examples:
- "Add pitch recording feature so founders can practice and get feedback"
- "Create meeting planning system to reduce VP Education workload"
- "Fix mobile navigation - founders can't find the meetings page"
```

**What CEO does NOT say:**
- ❌ Step-by-step instructions
- ❌ Technical implementation details
- ❌ Database schema designs
- ❌ "First do X, then do Y, then do Z"

### Collaborative Response Pattern
```
1. CEO: Define business outcome and reason
2. COO: Assess feasibility and provide strategic guidance
3. CTO: Propose technical approach
4. CEO: Approve approach
5. CTO: Execute completely (autonomous)
6. COO: Review quality
7. CEO: Validate business result
```

**Example:**
```
CEO: "Add pitch recording feature so founders can practice and get feedback"

COO: "Pitch recording is valuable for founder skill development. Recommend
      browser MediaRecorder API for simplicity, Supabase storage for recordings.
      Consider 5-min limit for free tier storage. Low risk, high business value."

CTO: "I'll implement pitch recording with MediaRecorder API, Supabase storage,
      5-min limit, and playback functionality. Estimate 3-5 hours. Proceed?"

CEO: "Approved - build it"

[CTO creates own implementation plan:]
- Write Supabase migration SQL (recordings table)
- Provide SQL to CEO for Supabase execution
- Build recording component with MediaRecorder
- Add 5-min time limit with progress indicator
- Implement playback functionality
- Test recording flow after CEO deploys SQL
- Deploy frontend to production

[CTO completes work]

CTO: "Pitch recording complete. Ready for review."

COO: [Reviews implementation quality, security, mobile-responsiveness]
     "Quality confirmed. MediaRecorder works across browsers, storage limits
      enforced, mobile-responsive. Meets technical and business standards."

CEO: [Tests functionality]
     "Perfect - founders can now practice and improve their pitches."
```

## Backlog System

**Purpose**: Capture future ideas without CEO needing to track them.

**File**: `docs/BACKLOG.md`

### Usage Pattern

**CEO adds items:**
```
"Code, backlog this: Add cross-club guest registration system"
OR
"CTO, backlog this: Add cross-club guest registration system"
```

**CTO response:**
1. Creates backlog entry with:
   - Unique ID (#007)
   - Scope breakdown
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Status: Backlogged
2. Confirms: "Added to backlog as #007"

**CEO does NOT:**
- ❌ Maintain task lists
- ❌ Track backlog status
- ❌ Manage priorities beyond "high/future/ideas"

**CTO owns:**
- ✅ All backlog maintenance
- ✅ Status tracking
- ✅ Implementation planning when item is prioritized

---

## Implementation Workflow

### 1. CEO Provides Instruction
```
"Implement feature X to achieve business outcome Y for [founders/members]"
```

### 2. COO Strategic Assessment
```
"Feasibility: [assessment]
 Risks: [potential issues]
 Recommendation: [approach guidance]
 Business Value: [impact analysis]"
```

### 3. CTO Proposes Approach
```
"I'll build [solution] using [technical approach].
 Estimate: [timeframe]. Confirm this meets your needs?"
```

### 4. CEO Approves
```
"Approved - build it"
OR
"Adjust: [specific business concern]"
```

### 5. CTO Autonomous Execution

**CTO creates own plan:**
- Break down into technical tasks
- Create implementation task list
- Make architecture decisions
- Execute all steps independently

**CTO does NOT:**
- Ask permission for each step
- Request approval for technical choices
- Report progress on individual tasks
- Wait for CEO or COO micromanagement

### 6. COO Quality Review
```
"Quality confirmed: [technical standards met]
 Security: [assessment]
 Performance: [evaluation]
 Business alignment: [verification]"
OR
"Issues found: [specific quality concerns requiring fix]"
```

### 7. CEO Validates Business Result
```
"Perfect - achieves the business objective"
OR
"Needs adjustment: [specific business requirement not met]"
```

---

## Decision-Making Authority

### CTO Full Authority (No Permission Needed)
- ✅ Database schema design
- ✅ Framework and library choices
- ✅ Code architecture patterns
- ✅ UI/UX implementation details
- ✅ Performance optimizations
- ✅ Security implementations
- ✅ Deployment strategies
- ✅ Testing approaches

### COO Advisory Role (Not Approval)
- ✅ Provide feasibility assessments
- ✅ Review quality after completion
- ✅ Recommend best practices
- ✅ Identify risks and trade-offs
- ❌ Does NOT block or approve CTO decisions
- ❌ Does NOT restrict CEO-CTO communication

### CEO Approval Required
- Business feature priorities
- Strategic technical approaches (before CTO executes)
- Customer/member-facing copy/messaging
- Brand identity elements
- Strategic pivots
- Major cost implications

## Example Sessions

### Example 1: Simple Feature Request

**CEO**: "Add LinkedIn icons to About page team member profiles"

**CTO Process** (internal, not reported):
1. Review About page template
2. Find official LinkedIn brand icons
3. Add to team member profiles
4. Implement hover states
5. Test on mobile and desktop
6. Commit changes

**CTO Report**: "LinkedIn icons added to About page profiles with hover effects. Works across devices."

**CEO**: "Perfect"

---

### Example 2: Complex Feature (3-Role Workflow)

**CEO**: "Build meeting planning system so VP Education can plan meetings in <15 minutes"

**COO**: "Meeting planning is critical operational pain point. Recommend:
- Drag-and-drop role assignment for UX
- Supabase for backend consistency
- Toastmasters standard meeting agenda templates
- Automated email notifications 48h before meetings
- Mobile-first design for last-minute changes
Risk: Low. Business value: High. Estimate: 8-12 hours."

**CTO**: "I'll build Supabase-backed meeting planning with drag-and-drop roles,
agenda templates, auto-notifications, and mobile optimization. Proceed?"

**CEO**: "Approved - build it"

**CTO Process** (internal, autonomous):
1. Design Supabase schema (meetings, roles, assignments tables)
2. Create SQL migrations with RLS policies
3. Build drag-and-drop role assignment component (@dnd-kit)
4. Add Toastmasters meeting agenda templates
5. Implement automated email notifications (48h trigger)
6. Add mobile-responsive styling
7. Test meeting planning flow end-to-end
8. Deploy to production
9. Document in docs/database/

**CTO**: "Meeting planning system complete. Ready for review."

**COO**: "Quality review complete:
- Security: RLS policies correct, role-based access working
- Performance: Fast load, efficient drag-and-drop
- Mobile: Responsive on all devices, 44px touch targets
- Standards: Meets Toastmasters requirements
Status: Approved"

**CEO**: [Tests meeting planning with VP Education]
"Perfect - planning time reduced from 45 min to 12 min. Excellent work."

---

### Example 3: Backlog Addition

**CEO**: "Code, backlog this: Add founder networking feature showing all Pitchmasters members' startups"

**CTO**:
"Added to backlog as #005: Founder Networking Directory
 - Scope: Display all members' startup profiles with industry, stage, location
 - Tech: Supabase query with RLS, search/filter UI
 - Status: Backlogged for future implementation"

**CEO**: "Good"

[Weeks later]

**CEO**: "Let's do the founder networking directory now"

**CTO**: [Reviews backlog #005, creates implementation plan, executes completely, reports results]

## Communication Efficiency

### High-Efficiency Pattern ✅
```
CEO: "Implement X for outcome Y"
COO: "Feasible. Recommend approach Z. Low risk, high value."
CTO: "I'll build using approach Z. Proceed?"
CEO: "Approved"
CTO: [Executes completely, autonomously]
CTO: "Complete. Ready for review."
COO: "Quality confirmed. Meets standards."
CEO: "Perfect - achieves outcome Y"
```

### Low-Efficiency Anti-Pattern ❌
```
CEO: "Implement X. First do A, then B, then C..."
CTO: "Completed A. Should I do B?"
CEO: "Yes, also add D"
CTO: "Done B and D. What about C?"
CEO: "Do C but change it to E"
[COO not consulted, technical quality unknown, CTO waiting for each step]
```
