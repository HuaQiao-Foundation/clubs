# Implementation Plans

Multi-session implementation plans for complex features requiring phased rollout.

## Purpose

This directory contains comprehensive plans that:
- Span 3+ development sessions
- Require multiple phases of implementation
- Document architecture and approach before execution
- Link to dev journals as phases complete

## Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-topic-description.md`

Example: `2025-12-georgetown-pwa-implementation.md`

## Plan Status Tracking

| Date | Plan | Status | Completion | Dev Journal |
|------|------|--------|------------|-------------|
| 2025-12-17 | [Georgetown PWA Implementation](georgetown-pwa-implementation.md) | ✅ Complete | 2025-12-17 | TBD |

## Plan Lifecycle

1. **Planning** - Architecture designed, phases outlined
2. **In Progress** - Active implementation underway
3. **Complete** - All phases implemented and tested
4. **Archived** - Superseded by newer approach (move to `docs/archive/`)

## Related Documentation

- **Dev Journals** (`docs/dev-journals/`) - Daily implementation logs as plan phases complete
- **ADRs** (`docs/adr/`) - Major architectural decisions referenced in plans
- **Prompts** (`docs/prompts/`) - Handoff instructions for resuming or delegating work
